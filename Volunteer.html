		<h2 class="a"> Whats's Involved </h2>
		<div = class="b"> 
			    We take what we do at ULSP very seriously and expect the utmost dedication and level of sincerity when carrying out our duties. We would like everyone to be able to make it to a minimum of 4 patrol nights out a month if possible (with extenuating circumstances taken into account). Other than that, just know that there will be <b>a lot</b> of walking and cycling around with a lot of downtime. So be prepared for some cold nights.<p></p>
			<br>Everyone is provided with ASIST, First Aid, Defibrillator, Throw Bag and VHF Radio training, as well any other courses that may be deemed relevant throughout the year. Some of these will be mandatory courses (such as First Aid and Defibrillator training), but don’t worry if you can’t make it to one of them as there will be many held throughout the year. <p></p>
			<br>Other than that, the actual patrols mainly consist of monitoring the UL campus (especially the bridge) and ensuring that no one is in obvious distress or seems inclined to take their own life. There will be rotas and everyone will be informed well in advance of there dates. Changes can be made if needed. For any further information, do not hesitate to call at 061 354 7653.
