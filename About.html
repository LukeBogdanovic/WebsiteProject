				<p class="a"> Our organisation was set up with the aim to prevent both self-harm and suicide.
				This is an especially common problem amongst young people. The most common age range for this to occur just so happens to coincide with the age range for that of college students. This is of course no coincidence, with the pressures of work, friends, family and everything else weighing heavily on people’s minds, some more so than others.
				This is the first time for many living independently, and with this can often come a lot of new feelings. With such a drastic change in peoples lives, they often feel anxiety, isolation, depression, self-loathing, low self-esteem and many others things.
				We, as students, have so much freedom for the first time in our lives, we don’t know what to do with it.
				So much is often expected of us, yet we don’t have an idea what we are doing. 
				<br><br> This is our organisations main reason for existing.
				We are here to try and prevent anyone from attempting to take their own life.
				We believe that no matter how bad you’re situation may be right now, it will eventually get better.
				All that you may need is to put things in perspective. 
				Listen to other people’s situations and see how your problems stack up against there’s. See how major your issue seems when stacked against another.
				See if your life is really the most difficult one to be living through on earth. Look at others who have gone through the same and see that they have made it through. Do what you need to do, talk to those you have to talk to, get the help you need. Just fully think through situation before doing anything drastic about it. Suicide leaves a trail of grief and sorrow in its wake; family and friends questioning what they did wrong, what they could have done better, how they could have stopped it.
				They beg for you back, would do anything to see you for even a moment. Don’t put them through that. Please. We are here.
				Talk to us 061 354 7653 or get in touch on ulsp@gmail.com. If not us, then maybe Samaritans (@ 116 123) or Pieta house (@ 061-484444).
